This is the /tags directory of the `kontenrahmen' Subversion repository.

  Subdirectories of this directory are stable snapshots; they may be
  named copies of particular trunk revisions, or they may be assembled
  from various revisions.  Either way, a tag is generally not changed
  after it is created.

See http://kontenrahmen.berlios.de/ for more information about the
'kontenrahmen' projekt.
